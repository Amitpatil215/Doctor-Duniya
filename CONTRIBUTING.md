# Contributing

Want to contribute to the Doctor Duniya? Great! First, read this

## So what should be contributed here, then?

Fixes and necessary improvements to the existing samples, mostly.

## Before you contribute

### File an issue first!

If you see a bug or have an idea for a feature that you feel would improve one
of the feature already in the repo, **please
[file an issue](https://github.com/Amitpatil215/Doctor-Duniya/issues/new) before you begin
coding or send a PR**. This will help prevent duplicate work by letting us know
what you're up to. It will help avoid a situation in which you spend a lot of
time coding something that's not quite right for the repo or its goals.

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

## A few ground rules

There are a few basic conventions that every project here is expected to follow.

Each app should:

* Be designed to build against the current
  [stable](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels)
  release of the Flutter SDK.
* Have no analyzer errors or warnings.
* Be formatted with `flutter format`.
* Avoid adding an onerous amount of blobs (typically images or other assets) to
  the repo.

In addition, this flutter code is, at the end of the day, still code. It should be
written with at least as much care as the Flutter code you'd find in the SDK
itself. For that reason, most of the
[Flutter style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo)
also applies to code in this repo.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.

Note:

* Avoid pushing code directly to master or stable branch.
* Use consistent branch for your contribution and  send PR to the master branch
* Provide more usefull Commit messages
* 1 PR for every change even if it is easy typo fix.
